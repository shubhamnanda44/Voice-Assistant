# Voice-Assistant
Voice Assistants are always handy and makes your work faster and easier. This assistant can fetch information from wikipedia, search on web, open websites and softwares, play music on your system, open files present on your system and you can add as many features as you want.


You should download "Rainmeter" software to use the skin which could be used as a user interface.
Either download "Rainmeter" and the relevant skin from the internet or directly from here.

Make sure you mention the correct location of the rainmeter you are using in the code.

Also, before running the program, make sure you set a solid black coloured wallpaper and all the desktop icons are hidden so that it does not interfere with the skin which you would be using.

Now when you run this program, a voice will be heard greeting the user and then "Rainmeter" will be opened by the program (quickly hover/click the cursor to the bottom right of the taskbar to switch to the desktop).
There is a code for the voice: engine.setProperty('voice', voices[0].id)
"voices[0]" is for male voice and "voices[1]" is for female voice.

After all this is done, it will wait for the user to speak and ask or give any command to the assistant.

Explore the project and make changes accordingly. Experiment if you want!
